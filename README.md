## Overview
Game Orbit is a platform to deploy a game portal in a short time even a publisher has no experience on coding or games. Game Orbit includes some components which are necessary to build a game portal. The number of components will increase time by time. The most important thing is to give a creative and elegant UX experience to players. It requires many developers and designers being involved in Game Orbit. So we are looking for developers and designers we can work together.

## Coding Challange

- Create two components
  - Component 1: We want to list games up to 5. It may fit all page completely.
